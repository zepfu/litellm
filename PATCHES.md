# AAWM LiteLLM Fork — Patch Registry and Migration Guide

This fork of [BerriAI/litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) tracks
upstream releases with AAWM-specific patches applied on top.

**Base version:** v1.82.3-stable.patch.4 (commit `1e10e5cc8f`, rebased 2026-04-10)

**Image format:** venv artifact (`FROM scratch` — not a runnable image). Consumed via `COPY --from=`.

**Callback wheel:** production callback changes are published separately from
`.wheel-build/` and consumed as a GitHub release wheel by the production image.
The in-repo callback at `litellm/integrations/aawm_agent_identity.py` and the
published wheel source under `.wheel-build/` must stay behaviorally aligned.
See `WHEEL.md` for the production wheel workflow and release path.

**Note:** aawm.1 (OAuth token preservation in `clean_headers` and
`_get_forwardable_headers`) was absorbed by upstream in PR #19912 (v1.81.13)
and is no longer carried as a separate patch.

## Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `aawm/patches` | Legacy production branch name from the original fork workflow. |
| `develop` | Integration branch — validated subsystem work should land here first. |
| `main` | Promotion branch — advances from `develop` after the full validation matrix passes. |

**Versioning scheme:** `{upstream_version}+aawm.{patch_number}` (PEP 440 local version)
Git tags use `v{upstream_version}-aawm.{patch_number}` (hyphen, since git tags aren't PEP 440).
Current carried patch set: `aawm.2`, `aawm.3`, `aawm.4`, `aawm.5`, `aawm.6`, `aawm.7`, `aawm.8` (7 active patches)

**Version metadata note:** `pyproject.toml` should stay aligned to this
registry's carried patch set. `litellm/_version.py` now reflects the installed
distribution version directly. The current working tree includes `aawm.8`;
bump package/version metadata when this checkpoint is committed.

**Current rebased checkpoint:** branch `rebase/upstream-1.82.3-stable.patch.4`
passed the local acceptance suite with artifact
`.analysis/artifacts/local-acceptance-20260410T232900Z.json`.

## Applied Patches

### aawm.2 — Skip x-api-key in /anthropic/ pass-through when OAuth token present

**File:** `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_passthrough_endpoints.py`
**Function:** `anthropic_proxy_route()`
**Upstream issue:** Claude Code uses the `/anthropic/v1/messages` pass-through
route, which bypasses the normal LiteLLM request pipeline. The pass-through
calls `get_credentials()` to build the `x-api-key` custom header. When
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set, `get_credentials()` returns `None`, resulting
in `x-api-key: None` being forwarded to Anthropic, which rejects the request.

**Fix:** Detect `Bearer sk-ant-oat` in the request's `Authorization` header.
When found, set `custom_headers={}` so no `x-api-key` is injected and the OAuth
bearer token passes through unmodified via `_forward_headers=True`.

**Why not upstream:** Upstream assumes API key auth. OAuth-only authentication
(no API key) is a non-standard configuration not currently supported upstream.

**Upstream watch:** v1.82.2+ adds `forward_llm_provider_auth_headers` and
`authenticated_with_header` in `clean_headers()`. This BYOK flow may eventually
supersede Patch 2. Monitor upstream BYOK for pass-through route coverage.

---

### aawm.4 — Agent identity callback for Langfuse trace naming

**File:** `litellm/integrations/aawm_agent_identity.py` (new file)
**Upstream issue:** LiteLLM has no built-in mechanism to extract agent/tenant
identity from Claude Code prompt content and map it to Langfuse trace naming.

**Fix:** Custom `AawmAgentIdentity(CustomLogger)` callback that:
- Extracts Claude Code subagent identity from prompt text like
  `You are 'orchestrator'` / `You are 'engineer'`.
- Rewrites `langfuse_trace_name` / fallback `metadata["trace_name"]` so traces
  become `claude-code.orchestrator`, `claude-code.engineer`, etc.
- Preserves a workable attribution model without requiring Claude Code to emit
  dynamic per-subagent headers.

**Why not upstream:** AAWM-specific identity injection scheme; not a general
upstream feature.

**Note:** Includes the unused-import fix (removal of `Union` import) that was
previously a separate `chore` commit — squashed into this patch.

**Upstream watch:** v1.82.2+ adds `x-litellm-agent-id` / `x-litellm-trace-id`
agent tracing headers. These are header-based (not system-prompt-based) and
require client support. Patch 4 remains needed because Claude Code cannot set
per-subagent headers dynamically.

### aawm.3 — Propagate request headers through pass-through logging handlers

**Files:**
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/pass_through_endpoints.py`
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_provider_handlers/anthropic_passthrough_logging_handler.py`
- `litellm/types/passthrough_endpoints/pass_through_endpoints.py`

**Upstream issue:** [Langfuse discussion #4848](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/discussions/4848).
The `AnthropicPassthroughLoggingHandler` builds `proxy_server_request` with
only a `body` field, never populating `headers`. Callback integrations like
`add_metadata_from_header` receive an empty headers dict and silently skip all
header-based metadata extraction.

**Fix:**
1. Add `request_headers: Optional[dict]` to `PassthroughStandardLoggingPayload`.
2. In `pass_through_request()`, call `clean_headers(request.headers)` and store
   the result as `request_headers` in the payload.
3. In `AnthropicPassthroughLoggingHandler.anthropic_passthrough_logged_success_handler()`,
   populate `proxy_server_request["headers"]` from `request_headers` when present.

**Why not upstream:** Upstream bug not fixed as of v1.82.1 (March 2026).

### aawm.5 — Google OAuth tokens in Gemini pass-through route

**Files:**
- `litellm/proxy/litellm_pre_call_utils.py`
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_passthrough_endpoints.py`

**Upstream issue:** The Gemini pass-through route requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` and
always injects it as a `key` query parameter. Google Cloud OAuth tokens
(`Bearer ya29.*`) cannot be used as an alternative authentication method.
Additionally, `clean_headers()` strips `Authorization` headers containing
Google OAuth tokens via the `_SPECIAL_HEADERS_CACHE` mechanism.

**Fix:**
1. In `clean_headers()`: extend the existing Anthropic OAuth preservation check
   to also preserve `Authorization` headers containing Google OAuth tokens
   (`Bearer ya29.*`). Change: extend `if is_anthropic_oauth_key(value)` to
   `if is_anthropic_oauth_key(value) or value.startswith("Bearer ya29.")`.
2. In `gemini_proxy_route()`: detect `Bearer ya29.*` in the Authorization header.
   When found, skip injecting the server-side `GEMINI_API_KEY` query param and
   enable `_forward_headers=True` so the OAuth token reaches Google's API.

**Why not upstream:** Upstream Gemini pass-through requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` and
does not support OAuth token-based authentication. GCP service-account tokens
and user OAuth credentials are an AAWM-specific use case.

**Upstream watch:** v1.82.2+ adds `authenticated_with_header` param to
`clean_headers()`. When we next rebase past v1.82.2, integrate the `ya29.*`
check with the new `authenticated_with_header` guard.

### aawm.6 — Codex-native passthrough with preserved client OAuth

**Files:**
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_passthrough_endpoints.py`
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/pass_through_endpoints.py`
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_provider_handlers/openai_passthrough_logging_handler.py`
- `tests/test_litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/test_llm_pass_through_endpoints.py`
- `tests/pass_through_unit_tests/test_pass_through_unit_tests.py`
- `tests/test_litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_provider_handlers/test_openai_passthrough_logging_handler.py`

**Upstream issue:** Redirecting Codex CLI to LiteLLM through the existing
OpenAI passthrough path does not work if LiteLLM forwards the Codex OAuth
bearer to the public `api.openai.com/v1/responses` API. The Codex bearer is
valid for Codex-native upstream traffic but does not carry the public
`api.responses.write` scope required by the OpenAI Responses API.

**Fix:**
1. Detect real Codex-native ingress on the OpenAI passthrough lane.
2. Preserve the inbound Codex OAuth bearer and native Codex headers.
3. Route the request to `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`
   instead of the public OpenAI Responses API.
4. Keep passthrough observability intact by masking raw auth in logs and
   hashing the inbound bearer before it lands in metadata.

**Why not upstream:** Upstream OpenAI passthrough assumes generic OpenAI API
traffic. This fork needs Codex-native passthrough semantics so Codex CLI can
stay logged in normally while LiteLLM acts only as the routing and
observability layer.

**Validation status:** Real `codex exec -p litellm` traffic succeeded through
`litellm-dev`, and Langfuse persisted traces with `name = "codex"`.

---

### aawm.8 — Codex streamed usage normalization and cost preservation

**Files:**
- `litellm/litellm_core_utils/llm_response_utils/convert_dict_to_response.py`
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_provider_handlers/openai_passthrough_logging_handler.py`
- `tests/test_litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_provider_handlers/test_openai_passthrough_logging_handler.py`
- `tests/llm_translation/test_llm_response_utils/test_convert_dict_to_chat_completion.py`

**Upstream issue:** Native Codex passthrough responses carry Responses-API-style
usage (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `input_tokens_details`, etc.), but the
chat-completion conversion and passthrough streaming logging paths were
normalizing them incorrectly. The result was a successful Codex response with
`prompt_tokens = 0`, `completion_tokens = 0`, and `response_cost = None` inside
LiteLLM even though Codex CLI itself reported non-zero usage.

**Fix:**
1. Normalize Responses-API-style usage dicts before constructing `Usage` in the
   completion-response conversion path.
2. Detect `/responses` streaming routes in the OpenAI passthrough logging
   handler and rebuild the final response from the actual `response.completed`
   event instead of the chat-completions stream builder.
3. Calculate passthrough streaming cost with `call_type="responses"` so Codex
   usage is costed on the correct path.
4. Add focused regression tests for both the direct conversion path and the
   streamed passthrough logging path.

**Why not upstream:** Upstream's generic OpenAI passthrough logging path does
not cover this Codex-native `/backend-api/codex/responses` streaming shape.
This fork needs accurate usage and pricing for native Codex CLI observability.

**Validation status:** Focused handler regression tests passed, and a fresh live
`codex exec -p litellm` run against rebuilt `litellm-dev` showed non-zero
`input_tokens`, `cached_input_tokens`, and `output_tokens` on the passthrough
response-completed path instead of zeroed usage.

### aawm.7 — Gemini Code Assist native passthrough and logging fixes

**Files:**
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_passthrough_endpoints.py`
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/pass_through_endpoints.py`
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/streaming_handler.py`
- `litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_provider_handlers/gemini_passthrough_logging_handler.py`
- `tests/test_litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/test_llm_pass_through_endpoints.py`
- `tests/pass_through_unit_tests/test_gemini_streaming_handler.py`
- `tests/test_litellm/proxy/pass_through_endpoints/llm_provider_handlers/test_gemini_passthrough_logging_handler.py`

**Upstream issue:** Gemini CLI `oauth-personal` traffic does not use the public
Gemini Developer API path for this workflow. It targets Google Code Assist on
`https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:...`. Upstream Gemini
pass-through behavior is API-key oriented and did not correctly support the
native Code Assist route, its streamed SSE chunk format, or its response
envelope shape for observability callbacks.

**Fix:**
1. Detect Gemini Code Assist ingress on `/gemini/v1internal:...`.
2. Preserve the inbound Google OAuth bearer and forward to
   `https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:...`.
3. Route streamed Gemini passthrough callbacks to the Gemini-specific logging
   handler instead of the generic Vertex path.
4. Parse SSE `data: {...}` chunks and unwrap Code Assist responses shaped like
   `{ "traceId": ..., "response": {...} }`.
5. Strip stale compression and transfer headers when reconstructing synthetic
   `httpx.Response` objects for logging transforms so the callback path does not
   trip `httpx.DecodingError`.

**Why not upstream:** Upstream Gemini pass-through is focused on API-key-based
Gemini API traffic. AAWM needs native Gemini CLI / Google Code Assist OAuth
passthrough with clean Langfuse logging and no OpenAI-compatible translation
layer.

**Validation status:** Real `gemini -p ... --output-format json` traffic
succeeded through `litellm-dev`, native `generateContent` and
`streamGenerateContent?alt=sse` both returned `200`, and Langfuse persisted
the Gemini traces.

## Dropped Patches

### aawm.1 — OAuth token preservation in clean_headers and header forwarding (DROPPED)

**Upstream status:** Merged in PR #19912, included in v1.81.13.
**What it did:** Preserved `Authorization` headers containing Anthropic OAuth
tokens (`sk-ant-oat*`) in `clean_headers()` and `_get_forwardable_headers()`.
**Action:** Dropped since v1.81.14 rebase. Upstream now handles this via
`is_anthropic_oauth_key()` in both functions.

aawm.5 extends the upstream `clean_headers()` fix to also cover Google OAuth
tokens (`ya29.*`).

## Upstream Version Upgrades

When upgrading to a new upstream LiteLLM version:

1. Fetch upstream tags: `git fetch upstream --tags`
2. Create new rebase branch: `git checkout <target-commit> -b aawm/patches-vX.Y.Z`
3. Cherry-pick AAWM commits in order (excluding any that were absorbed upstream).
4. Resolve conflicts (most likely in the patched files — check if upstream
   changed the target code blocks).
5. Update this file: version string, patch entries, dropped patches.
6. Tag: `git tag v{version}-aawm.{patch_count}`
